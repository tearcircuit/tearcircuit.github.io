    <div class="container1"> 
        <div class="boxItem1">1</div>
        <div class="boxItem2">The first thing I paid attention to was the loud orange that took over the entire screen, as well as the thin twin trails that followed my mouse around.</div>
        <div class="boxItem3"></div>
</div>

        <div class="boxItem5">I spent two minutes experiencing this site.
        Here is a list of my discrete actions. (hover) </div>
    <div class="hide"> - I waved my mouse around to make different shapes with the trails. I also did this idly as I was reading the text popups.<br>
    - I tried drawing something with the mouse trail.<br>- I clicked on some of the hyperlinks which opened up several boxes and then focused on one box at a time, following the trail of underlined text. <br> - I moved the text boxes around and closed one.<br>
    - I clicked on the button that toggled every text box on, then reloaded the page to go back to the start. </div>
     <div class="boxItem6"> </div>
  

</div>



 <div class="container3"> 
        <div class="boxItem7">3</div>
        <div class="boxItem8">While engaging with this site, I spent the most time clicking on the hyperlinks which prompted more text boxes to come up, then moving the text boxes around and out of the way once I was done reading them.  </div>
        <div class="boxItem9"></div>
</div>

 <div class="container4"> 
        <div class="boxItem10">4</div>
        <div class="boxItem11">The most common action I engaged in these two minutes was waving my mouse around to draw patterns.</div>
        <div class="boxItem12"></div>
</div>

 <div class="container5"> 
        <div class="boxItem13">5/6</div> 
        <div class="boxItem14">The aim of this interactive experience is to invoke the nature of the past and evolving internet and how the “internet raised” interact with it, in the past and present. Bite sized chunks of text, designed to keep your attention.</div>
        <div class="boxItem15">The act of clicking on hyperlinks that lead to more information is reminiscent of going through different Wikipedia pages or news articles, or even web surfing, clicking going through different websites and links with no aim in mind. </div>
        <div class="boxItem15v1">Popup prompts complete with the “x” button, which are also reminiscent of ads. Shorthand and text acronyms. </div>
        <div class="boxItem15v2">The mouse trails also reminded me of how bored students would scribble in the margins of their notebooks during classes, and for many of the “contemporary readers” who relate to the contents of this article, that era might have not been too long ago.</div>
    </div>

<div class="container6"> 
        <div class="boxItem16">7</div>
        <div class="boxItem17">The interesting thing about this experience is that it is not a typical article made of paragraphs of text that you simply scroll down to read. It pushes the reader to take their own journey, at their own pace. </div>
        <div class="boxItem18">It’s slightly guided but still non-linear, the reader can branch out and click on whatever they want to know more about. In this way, and with no context, the way it’s broken up into many small, interactable pieces, it is not immediately clear it is an essay.</div>
        <div class="boxItem18v1"> It is likely meant to be read in one go, piece by piece. However, there is the factor that with no clear end in sight, the user will be less willing to engage to the end because they don’t know how much attention they’ll need to be allocating to it.</div>
        <div class="boxItem18v2">The user might miss some windows or forget to go back and click on a few links, they might lose steam and get confused by which boxes they have and haven’t read. </div>
        <div class="boxItem18v3">They may come back to the article another day or walk away feeling like they’ve taken in enough. The designer has experimented with different modes of legibility and tailored ways of conveying information to the “contemporary internet user”.</div>
        <div class="boxItem18v4">The user is fed information in bite-sized, easily digestable, attention grabbing pieces, as the user is assumed to be someone with a short attention span or easily distractable, due to the nature of being “raised on the internet”.</div>
</div>

<div class="container7"> 
        <div class="boxItem19">8</div>
        <div class="boxItem20">The intentions and thought process behind every design choice is slowly revealed as the user reads on. Some features that might seem like flaws or oversights are intentional. </div>
        <div class="boxItem21"> This prompts the user to reconsider aspects of web design and their own expectations, why they came to be, and why not questioning or challenging these conventions can lead to dangerous mindsets and outcomes.</div>
</div>

<div class="container8"> 
        <div class="boxItem22">9</div>
        <div class="boxItem23">The basis of this experience has to do with digital legibility, and reading and comprehending information critically.</div>
        <div class="boxItem24">It references books, other essays and articles, the internet as a whole, its different states and niches, and how different it was in the past compared to now. An admiration and desire to capture the essences of older eras of the internet, especially of the 90's.</div>
</div>

<div class="container9"> 
        <div class="boxItem25">10</div>
        <div class="boxItem26">The references and links to external pages and examples communicate to me that this experience is not something that exists in a vacuum nor is it just a novelty, and every design choice is deliberate and often provocative. </div>
        <div class="boxItem27">The design and content work together and exist to inform and challenge, and that I should take initiative to inform and challenge these conventions myself.
</div>
</div>

<div class="container10"> 
        <div class="boxItem28">11</div>
        <div class="boxItem29">I think the references to different types of text throughout history and the essay contents combined with the format of the site itself indicate to the user that they should not feel bored while interacting with the experience, rather curious and thoughtful. </div>
</div>

<div class="container11"> 
        <div class="boxItem31">12</div>
        <div class="boxItem32">The most frustrating part of the experience was the overwhelming presence of the specific shade of orange. However, as stated, this colour is within the part of the visible spectrum that is easier to view and strains the eye less, which I found to be true. </div>
        <div class="boxItem33">I personally have conflicted feelings about it, despite it being a decent colour for reading, something about it feels suffocating.</div>
        <div class="boxItem33v1">The fact that once you click on a phrase that opens up a new prompt, and the more prompts/text boxes you have open, it becomes harder to backtrack what you are currently reading and link it to the paragraph that it came from. </div>
        <div class="boxItem33v2">This, like a few other choices, is actually purposeful, to avoid a mindmap-like structure, the designer is trying to create a format of reading and taking in information that is unique whilst still adhering to some conventions. </div>
        <div class="boxItem33v3">My dislike of it could just come from the fact that I’m not used to it and have never come across a form of text where I could not easily retrace my steps to recall context.</div>
</div>

<div class="container12"> 
        <div class="boxItem34">13</div>
        <div class="boxItem35">The most satisfying part for me was how the more you read, the more your mouse moves around to open and close new and old prompts, and the empty background is filled with lines and scribbles from the mouse trail as you navigate.</div>
        <div class="boxItem36"> It’s kind of like a measure of how much you’ve interacted with the article and how much you’ve taken in, like a tangible continuous mark of the journey taken.</div>
